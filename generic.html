									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Business Management graduate from the University of Southampton with a year in industry as a commercial strategy and operations intern at Universal Pictures International. 

										Described as a determined and hard working individual and would do whatever it takes to complete a task successfully.
										
										I am solution-focus, forward thinker with an analytical mind and able to adapt in continuous changing environments. My unique enthusiasm and drive is what pushes me every day to deliver high standards results and I am keen to prove this while taking on new challenges.<br />
									
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/PIC OF ME.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>At Universal, I gained valuable experience working in a dynamic, team-focused environment where I engaged in strategic and analytical tasks for cross-functional stakeholders to facilitate growth and revenue in EMEA, APAC and LATAM. I demonstrated my analytical skills by conducting data analysis based on KPIs from over 65 territories to spot growth opportunities and commercial trends and using data visualisation tools to present insights to senior management. Furthermore, I oversaw the preparation of monthly, quarterly, and annual reports of our key global clients for our senior management team. This analytical skill set, coupled with my ability to communicate complex information effectively, will be instrumental in delivering business recommendations, identifying risks/opportunities, and achieving forecast accuracy.
								</p>
								<p>In addition, I can demonstrate excellent strategic thinking and proactive mindset which I applied through my position as Vice President of Operations and Projects for Enactus Southampton where I executed strategic Go-To-Market initiatives and identified new growth opportunities that ranked us No.1 in the UK and No.3 worldwide. In 2021 oversaw 10 social enterprises that allowed me to develop excellent negotiation and interpersonal skills that facilitated our commercial partnerships for the projects. 
									Additionally, my 12-week consultancy project with the Ministry of Defence, focused on enhancing operational efficiency in the Royal Navy during the Ukraine crisis, allowed me to lead significant and complex analyses to drive improvements across the Navy to ensure mission success. It is precisely this ability to work with and manage multiple stakeholders on large data analysis projects that will enable me to excel on business-critical problems and present insights and opportunities for growth.
